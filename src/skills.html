            My skills mentioned in the table are the skills I have acquired
            through various learning experiences and practical applications.
            These skills encompass a range of technical skills that I have
            developed over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            At present, my primary focus is on front-end development. I am
            dedicating my efforts to mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as
            these are the fundamental technologies required for any front-end
            developer. By honing these skills, I aim to create visually
            appealing and user-friendly web interfaces that provide an excellent
            user experience.

        <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>
          The skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are self-taught through doing
          projects and watching videos and also some online classes. Learning on
          our own can be challenging at times. However, with dedication and
          effort, we can become good at what we're studying.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took an introductory Python course at Addis Ababa University (AAU),
          which provided me with a solid foundation in programming concepts and
          practices. However, my learning did not stop there. I am currently
          enhancing my Python skills through self-study, working on various
          projects and challenges to deepen my understanding and proficiency in
          the language.
